# The Personality Compass

Python implementation of a quick Personality Compass assessment.

## Description

The Personality Compass is a ground-breaking exploration of the main personality types which form the basis of societies the world over.  Tried and tested with astonishingly accurate results.  The Personality Compass shows how these differed temperaments correspond with the governing points of the compass, sharing the special characteristics that are assosciated with each direction.

This is an adaptation of Turner and Greco's Quick-Test for Type.  You will be presented with 60 pairs of words.  For each pair, read the choices and choose the word that describes you more often than the other (even though you may have both characteristics).  For the first 30 pairs you will make your selection by choosing either 'a' or 'b'.  For the second group of 30 pairs, you must make your selection by choosing either 'c' or 'd'.  You may also select 'q' at anytime to exit the program.

### Code Louisville Requirements Met:

* Implement a "master loop" console application where the user can repeatedly enter commands/perform actions, including choosing to exit the program.
* Create a dictionary or list, populate it with several values, retrieve at least one value, and use it in your program.
* Create and call at least 3 functions or methods, at least one of which must return a value that is used somewhere else in your code. To clarify, at least one function should be called in your code, that function should calculate, retrieve, or otherwise set the value of a variable or data structure, return a value to where it was called, and use that value somewhere else in your code. For example, you could create a function that reads how many items there are in a text file, returns that value, and later uses that value to execute a loop a certain number of times.
* Analyze text and display information about it (ex: how many words in a paragraph).
